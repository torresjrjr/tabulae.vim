tabulae.vim
===========
ðŸ“– A Vim spreadsheet calculator plugin.

Written by [torresjrjr](https://t.me/torresjrjr).

This is an ongoing project over Christmas 2019. tabulae.vim aims to be a Vim plugin
which opens spreadsheet-like, tab-delimited `.tae` files and allows spreadsheet
previews with live calculations. Essentially, this plugin will turn Vim into an
Excel-like TUI program.

Outline
-------
See [MODEL.md](MODEL.md) for more comprehensive detail.

tabulae.vim will work with internally defined `.tae` files, which are
tab-delimited files with special syntax, and are worked as spreadsheets.

Author's notes
-------------
I was inspired to make this plugin, because I was intrigued by _sc-im_, a
spreadsheet calculator with vim-like controls. However, I couldn't install and
try it out since I run _MSYS2_ on Windows, so I though I would make one myself.

### Reasons for tabulae.vim
- It's portable. Installs anywhere with Vim.
- Would use Vim-like controls natively.
- It's potentially useful for many cases.
- It's a nice challenge.
