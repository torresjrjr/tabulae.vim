tabulae.vim
===========
ðŸ“– A Vim spreadsheet calculator plugin.

Written by [torresjrjr](https://t.me/torresjrjr).

This is an ongoing project over Christmas. tabulae.vim aims to be a Vim plugin
which opens spreadsheet-like, tab-delimited `.tae` files and allows spreadsheet
previews with live calculations. Essentially, this plugin will turn Vim into an
Excel-like TUI program

Outline
-------
The outline for the plugin are as follows:

tabulae.vim will work with internally defined `.tae` files, which are
tab-delimited files with special syntax, and are worked as spreadsheets. See
[MODEL.md](MODEL.md) for more.

Authors notes
-------------
I was inspired to make this plugin, because I was intrigued by `sc-im`, a
spreadsheet calculator with vim-like controls. However, I couldn't install and
try it out since I run `MSYS2` on Windows, so I though I would make one myself.

I liked the idea of tabulae.vim because:
- It's portable. Installs anywhere with Vim.
- Would use Vim-like controls natively.
