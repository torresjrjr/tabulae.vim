This is an ongoing project over Christmas 2019. tabulae.vim aims to be a Vim plugin
which opens spreadsheet-like, tab-delimited `.tae` files and allows spreadsheet
previews with live calculations. Essentially, this plugin will turn Vim into an
Excel-like TUI program.

Outline
-------
See [MODEL.md](MODEL.md) for more comprehensive detail.

tabulae.vim will work with internally defined `.tae` files, which are
tab-delimited files with special syntax, and are worked as spreadsheets.

Progress
--------

### 2019 Dec 18:
Milestone ‚õ∞Ô∏è ! A rudimentary "view" buffer now works, with the `_EvalView()`
function. The `_EvalCell()` function is capable of basic data handling.

```vim
" ./examples/spreadsheet.tae
:source plugin/tabulae.vim | call _InitView() | call _EvalView() 
```

Todo:
- Discover concealing characters for metadata markers in the viewbuffer.
- Make `_EvalCell()` capable of evaluating equations/formulae.
- Make a true `_SetCell()` function (unlikely needed, since side effects of
  setting multiple cells is desirable).
- Improve in data type distinction, and standardise metadata sequences (likely
  will be similar to ANSI escape sequences).
- Decide how to define a cell with leading whitespace.
- Decide on local/buffer settings, like 'listchars', 'buftype', etc.
- Consider efficiency improvements regarding `_itercellpos()` and minimising
  evaluations (consider the viewport, or a history of dependant cells or
  evaluated cells).
- Make plugin work around `.tae` filetype buffers.
- Consider how 'workbooks' would work (a spreadsheet on each tab, with methods
  to link data and navigate between one other, like `gf`). How would buffer
  and tab management work? How would a workbook file structure work?
- Consider conditional or inherited formatting based on the metadata of a
  cell's column's header cell. This could save space by only writting metadata
  once per each column.

### 2019 Dec 31 - New Years Eve
Completely new model. There are now more functions handling buffers, cells and
more.

`.tae` files are now read into an intermediate _eval_ buffer, where cells
with metadata containing the equation/formula attribute are evaluated
(recursively if dependant on other un-evaluated cells.

Then, further proccesing is given to a _view_ buffer, which will correspond to an
individual spreadsheet (meaning multiple _view_ buffers are possible). Functions
will iterate over all cells, formatting them by there metadata. The result is a
simple, tab-delimited spreadsheet, formatted and with all evaluated values.

These view buffers will have a special interface, with the cursor spanning a
cell, and motion and editing based on a spreadsheet design. `hjkl` will navigate
the view buffer spreadsheet by cells, and `i`/`c`/`d` will edit cells.

In the future, I hope to create an _edit_ buffer, which will handle single cells
and their content. Such a buffer would handle editing easier, as opposed to the
given method of editing the `.tae` file by hand. Content once `ZZ`'ed could be
preproccessed; for example, a multi-line string could have it's newline chars
converted to `\n` escape sequences in compliance to the `.tae` specification.

Much is left for imagination. I hope to continue this to it's minimum viable end.

Author's notes
-------------
I was inspired to make this plugin, because I was intrigued by _sc-im_, a
spreadsheet calculator with vim-like controls. However, I couldn't install and
try it out since I run _MSYS2_ on Windows, so I though I would make one myself.

### Reasons for tabulae.vim
- It's portable. Installs anywhere with Vim.
- Would use Vim-like controls natively.
- It's potentially useful for many cases.
- It's a nice challenge.
